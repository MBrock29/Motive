Notes

- Please note that the app is not fully responsive. I have inserted media queries and breakpoints to show how I would deal with the responsiveness were I to have more time.

- With more time I would also look at enhancements such as pagination for the ships, given the number returned from the fetch (something that can be done with limits and offsets through the SpaceX API).

- I have added a button component (unused in the app) to show how I would focus the design on configuration over customisation were the project needed to be scaled up.
